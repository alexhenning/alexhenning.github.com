I just added <a href="http://disqus.com/overview/">disqus</a> comments to the blog. Disqus allows me to embed a little bit of javascript into the page and then <code>poof</code> comments are magically embedded in the page. The site is still statically generated, disqus handles all of the dynamic comments for me.
