<p>
Adding a default icon isn't that hard, just find a <code>16x16</code> image you want to use and save it as <code>favicon.ico</code>. After that, add the following line in your <code>_layouts/default.html</code>:
</p><pre class="example">
&lt;link rel="SHORTCUT ICON" href="/favicon.ico"&gt;
</pre>

<p>I made a cute little lambda:
<img src="/favicon.ico" />

That's all for now, hopefully within the next week, I'll have everything setup and start blogging about my projects!
