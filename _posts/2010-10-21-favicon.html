<p>
Adding a default icon isn't that hard, just find a <code>16x16</code> image licensed under the creative commons that you want to use or make an image. Save the image as <code>favicon.gif</code>.
</p>
<p>
I made a cute little lambda:
<img src="/favicon.gif" />
.
</p>

That's all for now, hopefully within the next week, I'll have everything setup and start blogging about my projects and other interesting things!
