<p>
When writing synonym.el, I tried doing it as a literate program. I haven't done a whole lot of literate programming yet, and I have a few issues with it.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>I still see the the non-code as comments</dt><dd>Whereas in literate programming, the non-code should be more of a narrative that tries to explain everything.
</dd>
<dt>I don't write enough of the "narrative"</dt><dd>And what I write feels much more like a repetition of the code than a complement of it.
</dd>
<dt>I leave out doc-strings</dt><dd>They feel like even more repetition on top of the narrative.
</dd>
<dt>The narrative falls out of sync with the code</dt><dd>This is the same problem that comments suffer, but it's even more confusing in a literate program.
</dd>

<p>
The only two things I really like are the <b>code folding</b> and the ability to have all the code in one big file that the separates out into logical modules.
