My favorite license is <b>WTFPL</b>. The actual content according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL">wikipedia</a>:

As you can see, it's very short and straight forward. You can do whatever you want. I was looking at it again today, when I realized that most of my code on github didn't have an actual license. So, I went back and licensed them under the WTFPL, because quite frankly, I wrote most of it for the fun of writing it and learning. I don't want any of the nonsense associated with longwinded licenses.

That said, I'm licensing the code to this blog under the <b>WTFPL</b>, but keeping the license to the content of the posts. <b>Why?</b> Because, I don't really feel copies of my ramblings spread over the internet randomly. That said, if you actually have a good reason, just ask me for permission.
