<p>I am a freshman at WPI double-majoring in <b>Computer Science</b>
and <b>Robotics Engineering</b>. In high school my passion was
programming and robotics. On our schools robotics team, I switched
between being the lead programmer and the only programmer for four
years, in addition to being the team captain my senior year. In 2008,
we made it to second place at the championship event.</p>

<p>In high school, I also coded a number of small projects for
fun. This includes a number of games such as
<a href="https://github.com/alexhenning/Tug-of-War">Tug-of-War<a>,
<a href="https://github.com/alexhenning/The-Gravity-Game">A Gravity
Game</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/alexhenning/Learning-Twenty-Questions">A
Learning Twenty Questions</a>. I also have a number of other projects
on <a href="https://github.com/alexhenning">github</a> and quite a few
other projects I never made public.</p>

<p>I do freelancing work on interesting projects. I find tasks
involving AI, Sentiment Analysis, Machine Learning, Automation of
tasks both virtual and physical interesting and much more. For some
examples of my work and what I find interesting look
at <a href="/projects/">my public projects</a>.</p>
