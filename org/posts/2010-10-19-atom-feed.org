** Setting up an RSS feed
Once you've set up a blog, you might want to set up an RSS feed. And if you don't, well then, too bad! Setting up an RSS feed is quite simple with jekyll. First create a file called =atom.xml=.
: > touch atom.xml

Next, just copy my [[http://github.com/alexhenning/alexhenning.github.com/blob/master/atom.xml][=atom.xml=]] into your =atom.xml=, changing username, email and the site to fit your site. It's a pretty plain file, mostly just saying that it's an atom feed

#+BEGIN_SRC xml -n -r
   { % for post in site.posts limit:25 % } (ref:begin-loop)
   <entry>
     <title>{ { post.title } }</title>
     <link href="http://alexhenning.github.com{ { post.url } }"/>
     <updated>{ { post.date | date_to_xmlschema } }</updated>
     <id>http://alexhenning.github.com{ { post.id }}</id>
     <content type="html">{ { post.content | xml_escape } }</content>
   </entry>
   { % endfor % } (ref:end-loop)
#+END_SRC

However, this segment is pretty interesting, jekyll runs a loop that creates an atom <entry> for the last 25 posts posted. You can remove =limit:25= to show all posts ever, but that would become obnoxious after you got a large number of posts. Just pick a number that seems reasonable and go with it.
