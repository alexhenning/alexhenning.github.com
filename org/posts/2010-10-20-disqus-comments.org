I just added [[http://disqus.com/overview/][disqus]] comments to the blog. Disqus allows me to embed a little bit of javascript into the page and then =poof= comments are magically embedded in the page. The site is still statically generated, disqus handles all of the dynamic comments for me.

Scroll down and try them out!
