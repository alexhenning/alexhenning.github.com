Adding a default icon isn't that hard, just find a =16x16= image you want to use and save it as =favicon.ico=. After that, add the following line in your =_layouts/default.html=:
: <link rel="SHORTCUT ICON" href="/favicon.ico">
I made a cute little lambda:
#+BEGIN_HTML
<img src="/favicon.ico" />
#+END_HTML

That's all for now, hopefully within the next week, I'll have everything setup and start blogging about my projects!
