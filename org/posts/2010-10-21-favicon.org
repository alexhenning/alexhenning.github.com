Adding a default icon isn't that hard, just find a =16x16= image licensed under the creative commons that you want to use or make an image. Save the image as =favicon.gif=.

I made a cute little lambda:
#+BEGIN_HTML
<img src="/favicon.gif" />
#+END_HTML
.

That's all for now, hopefully within the next week, I'll have everything setup and start blogging about my projects and other interesting things!
