There was a [[http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1827021][discussion]] on hacker news about =yahoo pipe=. After reading it, I decided to give it a try and write one to provide alerts for homework in one of my classes. After playing around with it for a bit, I managed to get a [[http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=2b3ba7027d8dd84e949b1a95618122f2][pipe]] up in running.

Overall, I found =pipes= easy to use and fairly intuitive once I got going. However, I have previous experience programming. I found it fairly similar to =labview=, a graphical programming language used for many scientific purposes. It was easier to use and much less painful then =labview= with nice thick connections. Another key difference is it's ability to easily inspect the results each step of the way, which makes debugging and tinkering around in =pipes= very easy.

The biggest problem I found was the limited set of operators, although more sufficient than nothing. Even though it felt rather limited, when I became more familiar with it, I was able to do everything I wanted to do with one key exception. I was unable to get the pubDate field to what I wanted, in part because I don't actually know the puDate. However, this problem is irrelevant, I created a [[http://alerts.yahoo.com/myalerts.php][yahoo alerts]] to create an alert that emails me when the homework is updated.
