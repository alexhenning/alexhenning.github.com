Today I went to River Rage a post season FIRST Robotics competition with team 348. It was very enjoyable, we ended up as semifinalists, which wasn't quite what I hoped for. However, it was quite good.

They mixed some things up, for alliance selection, alliances 1-8 selected then 1-8 again as opposed to the annoying snake selection thing FIRST normally does. Also, Alliances couldn't choose other teams in the top 8 which prevented the two best teams from getting together and dominating.

When it actually came to running the elimination matches, they had some ridiculous bracket. It made absolutely no sense to me. It might have if I had seen it on paper. It was annoyingly confusion. Enough complaining though.

It was a very fun day, and every one on our team got to go up!
