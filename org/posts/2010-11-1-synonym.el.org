Synonym.el is an elisp package that adds synonym support to emacs. Have you ever been writing something and then couldn't think of the right word? Want a synonym? Why should you have to leave that comfy world that is emacs to find a synonym?

Now you don't have to. A quick =M-x t= and you're presented with a list of synonyms, just like autocomplete.el, but with synonyms. Right now, it's pretty dumb, and just fetches the synonyms from a server every time you access it. That's far from ideal, I plan on caching it at some point.
